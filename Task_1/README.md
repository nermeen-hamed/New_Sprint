1- What ’re the methods that you used ?

       -itertools.product()
       -input().split()
       -permutations(iterator, r)
       -combinations(,)
       -sorted(string)
       -itertools.groupby(iterable, key)
       -len()


2- Explain each method ..
        -itertools.product() is used to find the cartesian product from the given iterator
        
        -input().split() it is used to split the input into list 
        
        -permutations(iterator, r)   takes an iterator and ‘r’ (length of permutation needed) as input and assumes ‘r’ as default length of iterator if not mentioned and           returns all possible permutations of length ‘r’ each
        
        -sorted() used to sort the string or list that given to it
        
        -len() Function that is used to get length of the list or the string that given to it
        
        -itertools.groupby(iterable, key)   This method calculates the keys for each element present in iterable. It returns key and iterable of grouped items.
